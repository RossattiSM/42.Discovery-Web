# Discovery Web Piscine
This repository contains the projects I made during the Discovery Web Piscine in 42 MÃ¡laga, from ```Nov/22/2022``` to ```Nov/26/2022.```

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, peer to peer learning with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. 
The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the selection process for becoming a former student.

## Hard Skills

```
# Shell
  The Cell 0 Project contains the basics for Shell to navigate throughout the terminal.
  
# HTML
  The Cell 1 Project contains the basics for understanding HTML.
  In the Rush, we combine the 3 languages to create a website.

  In the Rush, we combine the 3 languages to create a website.
